#### Light mode

(coming soon)

### Goal: Design a dashboard with Tailwind that’s loosely inspired by Discord

#### Requirements

- Create a dashboard similar to “Card layout with sidebar” https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/page-examples/home-screens

- √ But try to make it look more like Discord, like the icon sidebar.

- √ Use create-react-app

- √ Use tailwind JIT

- ⌛️ Must be responsive (just large/small layouts)

- ⌛️ Must have light/dark mode.

- √ Create components for anything reusable, i.e`<Button color=”purple” >`
