# In Progress

## Tailwind CSS demo

### Goal: Design a dashboard with Tailwind that’s loosely inspired by Discord

#### Requirements

- Create a dashboard similar to “Card layout with sidebar” https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/page-examples/home-screens

- But try to make it look more like Discord, like the icon sidebar.

- Use create-react-app

- Use tailwind JIT

- Must be responsive (just large/small layouts)

- Must have light/dark mode.

- Create components for anything reusable, i.e`<Button color=”purple” >`

### TODO:

- [ ] Add theme mode toggle icon/logic

- [ ] Add responsiveness for small screens

- [ ] Add a custom font

- [x] Add better dummy data

- [x] Add some animations

- [x] Customize/tweak neutrals

- [x] Break the component tree down

- [x] Clean up components and styles
